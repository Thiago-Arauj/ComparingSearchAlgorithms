## Search Algorithms Visualization and Performance Analysis

This project implements and visualizes several search algorithms, comparing their performance across different list sizes. It includes both linear and binary search techniques, as well as advanced variations such as adaptive binary search and exponential search. The program also provides detailed scatter plots to visualize the search process.

## Features

- **Search Algorithms**:
  - Linear Search
  - Linear Search with Sentinel
  - Ordered Linear Search
  - Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)
  - Adaptive Binary Search
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - Exponential Search combined with Binary Search
  
- **Visualization**:
  - Scatter plots dynamically updated during the search process.
  - Highlights the current position and target value for better understanding.

- **Performance Measurement**:
  - Measures execution time for each algorithm in microseconds.
  - Compares performance across list sizes (10, 100, 1000, 5000).

- **Binary Search Tree Construction**:
  - Builds a BST iteratively to avoid recursion depth issues.
